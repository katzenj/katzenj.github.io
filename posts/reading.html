    <h2>Why it matters (to me)</h2>

Ever since I was younger and sped through the Ranger's Apprentice and Warriors books, I've loved reading and getting engrossed in books. Only recently have I ventured out more and started to add non-fiction to my rotation. My reading tastes vary dramatically - I just finished two very different but extremely good books: <u>Heavy</u> by Kiese Laymon and <u>The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo</u> by Stieg Larsson.

Last year I made a goal to read 12 book. I finished book #37 on December 30th. I had two internships last year and finished my second-to-last year of college and still continued to read even if it just meant five minutes here or there. The Libby app makes reading exponentially easier and gives me the ability to read on the go, find new books, and read totally for free because it's linked to my library cards.

    <h3>WHY SHOULD I CARE</h3>
    <p>
        Mainly, I think if you start with a goal that you find attainable and take just five minutes here or there to read, you'll find yourself exceeding your goal and reading for longer. Plus you could easily find yourself enjoying the reading and spending your time more intentionally.

Reading provides relief from stress, the ability to learn new things (e.g. reading <u>Thinking Fast and Slow</u>), and/or time to just sit back and enjoy yourself. No matter what genre you're reading, there's something to be learned and some way in which the book can benefit you.
