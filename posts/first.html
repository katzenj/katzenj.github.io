        For awhile now, I've thought about creating a blog whether it be through Gatsby, Jekyll, Wordpress, etc. I honestly spent more time thinking about doing it and looking into ways to develop it than I needed, especially considering I decided to just write this up in simple HTML/CSS and manually create posts this way.

        There might be some software development related posts here and there. But I love music, sports, and a bunch of other things, so odds are it'll just be a collection of different topics. Just depends on what I'm feeling. Anyways, here's a pic of my pup - photo credits to my sister.

    <h3>WHAT'S NEW</h3>
    <p>
        For anyone who got to this point, I recently signed a full-time offer with an awesome company based in SF, Affirm. So, I'm just finishing up my last year of college and have too much free time, which ultimately led to the creation of this, and time to work on side projects.

        In other news, <strong>WIINSTON</strong> just released their debut album - pretty good, but was hoping for a few more new songs. <strong>Amir Obe</strong> just released Chapter 3. And <strong>Jimmy Butler</strong> was very recently traded to the Sixers.
